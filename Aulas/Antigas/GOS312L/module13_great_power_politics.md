# Great Power Politics
- peace terms great powers set for war determine structure of internat system for decades to follow
	- shows importance of violence as shaping internat relations
	- exs: Napoleonic Wars (1815), WWI (1919), WWII (1945), Cold War (1990)
- end of WWI & Cold War created new state lines following the collapse of a hegemony
	- formation of NATO meant to ensure success of dem'cy in new states
- Versailles treaty intended to prevent Germany from threatening Eur w/ military power

## Woodrow Wilson

- avoided this post WWII - Warsaw Pact
	- 1944, Breton Woods - planned internat economic order

# Russian Influence in International Politics
- Cold War was NOT great power war (this term refers to "hot wars")

## Structural Changes post Cold War
- territorial changes w/ former soviet satellites
- economic changes- nations joining EU
- world now "unipolar" - dominated by US
- Warsaw pact collapsed, NATO expanded to compensate
- Russia itself "gained independence" from USSR
	- still, collapse of USSR considered defeat by Russia
	- loss of territory, control over Eur, superpower status & legitimacy of ideology
	- war w/ Ukraine comes from desire to reclaim what was lost
- US gained hegemony w/ nations joining NATO, and w/ legitimacy of democracy
	- like WWI, WWII, question over what to do w/ weakened Russia
	- fear Russian turmoil could result in violence, esp. use of nuclear weapons
	- Clinton helped establish dem'cy in Russia, strengthen NATO as failsafe
- Putin's rise made Russia more unified, autocratic & anti-western

# Greater Power Peace
- proxy wars may continue- but are direct, great power hot wars over?
	- US & Russia coordinated airstrikes in Syrian civil war to ensure neither hit the other
- w/o great power wars, US might be able to persist indefinitely

## Causes of Great Power Peace
- states can become wealthy thru comparative advantage, not just accumulation of resources
	- consequence of internat trading system
- secure 2nd strike capabilities - impossible to wipe out an opponents entire nuclear arsenal in one surprise attack
	- M.A.D???
- unipolarity - US hard to challenge
