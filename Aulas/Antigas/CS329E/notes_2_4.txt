Three types of machine learning
* Supervised learning - labeled data
* Unsupervised learning - unlabled data
* Reinforcement learning - unlabeled input, model creates categories, user gives feedback, model tries again
	** e.g. teaching computer to play chess

--Decision Trees--
* nominal, continous & ordinal attribute splits
algorithm:
	1.) if all records belogn to same class or have same attr values, leaf node
	2.) else, choose an attribute to partition & split on
* choose attributes depending on impurity of child nodes
	** entropy
	** gini
* continuous attribute splits-
	** split at point where predicted label changes

	Class:  no,  no,  no,  yes, yes, yes, no,  no,  no,  no
	Income: 60,  70,  75,  85,  90,  95,  100, 120, 125, 220

	** split at 80 or at 97.5
