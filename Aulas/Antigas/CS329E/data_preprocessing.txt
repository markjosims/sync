Categorical, qualitative
* nominal attributes - can be compared only on basis of equality
* ordinal - can be compared along spectrum
Numeric, quantitative, continuous
* interval - numeric, difference btw 2 vals is meaningful
* ratio - ratio btw vals is meaningful

* data not always in a table (DNA sequence, video, txt)

* data science process:
	1. data preprocessing
		fusing 
		cleaning
		exploration
		sampling
		aggregating
		feature engineering
		dimmensionality reduction
	2. data mining
		modeling
		statistics
		machine learning
	3. postprocessing
		visualization analysis

*** data science is an ITERATIVE PROCESS; it goes back and forth
among these steps ***

data cleaning
	- data is typically not collected in a way
	that lends itself to straightforward analysis
	- tends to take "up to 80% of the time"
	- tedious

	* ways of handling missing data
		- list wise deletion (drop row w/ missing value)
		- pair wise deletion (just ignore missing value)
		- imputation (filling in most likely value)

noise vs. outliers
	- outliers are anomalous values, but still legitimate data (Bill Gates in a bar)
		-- can be multivariate (250lbs person not an outlier, 5' person not an outlier,
		but a person who is 250lbs and 5' is an outlier)
	- noise is statistically erroneous (misreporting income of $100k as $100 million)

univariate analysis
	- go one variable at a time
	- numeric, continuous: look at mean, median, mode, distribution etc.
	- categorical: look at frequency tables, bar charts, pie chart

bivariate analysis
	- after univariate
	- two numeric, continous
		-- scatter plot
		-- correlation coefficient
	- two categorical features
		-- two-way table (how many data have feature a and feature b?)
		-- chi-squared test
		-- stacked bar chart
	- continuous & categorical
		-- box plots
		-- Z-test
