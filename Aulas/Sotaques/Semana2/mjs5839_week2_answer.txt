In GAE as described in handout #1, the vowels /ɔ/ and /ɑ/ are merged, but in the Southern Michigan dialect they are distinct. Also, in Southern Michigan the vowels /ɛ/ and /æ/ are phonetically so close that they are mainly distinguished not by the formant value at midpoint but by the direction of change of F2 during the vowel's duration - whether F2 is increasing or decreasing. Finally, the vowel /u/ is further back and high in Southern Michigan English than in GAE.
