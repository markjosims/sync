# Enforcement

- violations of privacy typically handled in civil cases, not criminal cases
  - hard to convict a single person when an entire business violates privacy law
  - burden of proof needed is too great
- civil cases can provide compensation; appeals thru administrations can be easier and acheive change

# Self-Enforcement

- privacy by design
- "proactive/preventative, not reactive/remedial"
- privacy is **default state** of technology
  - no spam unless you _opt in_
- privacy is **embedded** in design
  - Facebook is bad example
- privacy is **positive-sum**
- end to end security
  - no point of data lifecycle is compromised
  - privacy impossible w/o security
  - protect data until it is _d e s t r o y e d_
